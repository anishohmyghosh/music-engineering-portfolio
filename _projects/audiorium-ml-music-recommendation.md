## Introduction

**Audiorium** is named after a fusion of *audio* + *museum / terrarium / aquarium* — a space where users cultivate their own ecosystem of music. The application was built around one core idea: music recommendation should be driven by sonic and semantic meaning, not by engagement metrics, streaming counts, or label affiliation.

**Research Question:**
> How can machine learning be utilized to develop a music recommendation algorithm that works beyond searching?

**Target users:** Music lovers who want to go beyond the mainstream and genuinely diversify what they listen to.

---

## The Problem

With the emergence of music streaming, recommendation algorithms have become a primary force in culture curation and global discovery. Current platforms suffer from two compounding issues:

- **Feature Translation Gap:** Audio features used in mainstream algorithms struggle to translate inclusively across genres and cultures.
- **Recommendation Homogenization:** Algorithmic optimization for engagement creates echo chambers of western pop dominance — rewarding the familiar and profitable rather than delivering transformative experiences.

---

## Dataset

**Free Music Archive (FMA) Small Dataset** — the standard benchmark for genre classification and audio feature extraction.

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| Genre coverage | 161 genres, from broad (Rock) to niche (Glitch) |
| Dataset sizes | Small (8k tracks) → Full (106k tracks) |
| Precomputed features | MFCCs, Chroma, and more |
| License | Creative Commons — open for raw audio research |

---

## Methods

Audiorium combines three complementary AI capabilities:

| Capability | Model | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Text-to-Audio Search | CLAP | Natural language queries mapped to audio embeddings |
| Audio-to-Audio KNN | CLAP | Find tracks with similar sonic principal components |
| Image-to-Audio | OpenCLIP | Visual context mapped to audio via shared latent space |

Additional design decisions:
- Inspired by Spotify's **Text2Track** and **MusicMakerHub**
- **Rule-Based Ordering** adds slight randomization to top results, ensuring equitable distribution of diverse content over pure similarity ranking

---

## System Architecture

![Audiorium System Flow](/assets/images/projects/audioriumflow.png)

The system runs two parallel pipelines:

**Search pipeline (text or image input):**
```
User Prompt / Photo  →  CLAP text-to-audio / OpenCLIP image-to-audio
                     →  Top N Songs (Track ID + Accuracy Score)
                     →  Rule-Based Ordering
                     →  Recommendation Songs & Artist
```

**Queue pipeline (song selection):**
```
User Selects a Song  →  CLAP audio-to-audio KNN
                     →  Top N Songs (Track ID + Accuracy Score)
                     →  Rule-Based Ordering
                     →  Automatic Queue of Songs
```

**FAISS Index:** All audio is pre-embedded using CLAP and stored in a FAISS `IndexFlatIP` (cosine similarity via L2-normalized inner product) for fast nearest-neighbor retrieval at scale.

---

## User Interface

The GUI is a hybrid of a **text-bar interface** (like ChatGPT) and a **standard media player** (like Spotify). Prototyped in **Rork**, a Lovable/Cursor-based AI app prototyping tool using JSON prompting.

**Interface elements:**
- Central search bar for natural language queries
- Photo upload / camera access directly from the search bar (multimodal input)
- Results (playlists, artists) surface dynamically above the input
- Sidebar: search history, playlists, user library
- Conceptual 3D universe / neural map of music for visual discovery

**Changes from initial proposal:**
- Geolocation (Pokémon GO-style music discovery) was cut from scope
- Image-to-Audio input was added to make the experience more interactive

## Evaluation

### Methodology

![Evaluation Design](/assets/images/projects/audieval.png)

Recommendations were collected from Audiorium, Spotify, and Apple Music, then evaluated across two dimensions — algorithmic (1,000 songs) and via user study (10 songs).

---

### Quantitative: Homogeneity Score

Measures the proportion of **major-label artists** in the top-100 recommendations (0 = fully independent, 1 = all major label). The population baseline — the real-world ratio of label to non-label music — is **0.3**, making that the ideal target score.

| | Audiorium | Spotify | Apple Music |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Homogeneity Score** | **0.28** | 0.61 | 0.83 |

*Table 1: Homogeneity scores for 1,000 recommended songs per algorithm*

Audiorium's score of **0.28** is the closest to the 0.3 target, confirming the algorithm is effectively label-blind and does not reward streaming popularity or label affiliation.

---

### Qualitative: User Study (Likert 1–5)

Participants listened to recommendations from each platform and rated them on diversity and likability.

| Measure | Audiorium | Spotify | Apple Music |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Diversity** | **3.62** | 2.21 | 1.35 |
| **Likability** | 1.49 | 3.25 | 2.51 |

*Table 2: Likert scale means for user perception of diversity and likability*

Audiorium achieved the **highest diversity score** by a significant margin. The lower likability score is attributed to a known confounding variable: Audiorium's recommendations come from an open-source dataset, while Spotify and Apple Music surface commercially released and professionally produced music that participants are more predisposed to enjoy.

---

## Future Work

- Retrain on the **Free Music Archive Large Dataset** (106k tracks) for broader coverage
- **Longitudinal studies** comparing commercial algorithms to Audiorium over days to weeks of real use
- Quantify the performance of the **image-to-audio recommendation** capability independently
- Explore integration with real-world music catalogs to reduce the open-source dataset confound in likability evaluation

---

## Setup & Usage

### Requirements

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers faiss-cpu spotipy librosa soundfile requests
```

> Also requires **ffmpeg**: `brew install ffmpeg`

### Run

```bash
python audiorium.py
```

On first run, the script embeds all audio in `mp3dataset/` and saves a FAISS index (`clap_music_index.faiss`) and track ID list (`ids.pkl`) to disk. Subsequent runs load the index instantly — no re-embedding needed.

### Query Examples

```python
# Text-to-audio search
recommend_by_text(\"chill lo-fi with piano and rain\")
recommend_by_text(\"aggressive 808 trap with dark strings\")

# Audio-to-audio similarity
recommend_by_audio(\"mp3dataset/Plain.mp3\")
```
